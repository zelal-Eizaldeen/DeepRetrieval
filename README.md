## News
- [2025-05-19] If you're particularly interested in RAG tasks, we recommend checking out our latest work, [s3](https://github.com/pat-jj/s3), a training-efficient framework specifically designed for RAG.
- [2025-05-06] You can now easily deploy our model and call the api for query rewriting. See [here](https://github.com/pat-jj/DeepRetrieval?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-easy-to-use-api-for-query-rewriting) for more details.
- [2025-02-28] 🎉 We are excited to release the code for DeepRetrieval!


## What is DeepRetrieval?

DeepRetrieval is a novel reinforcement learning approach that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) for query generation to enhance information retrieval performance. Unlike traditional methods that rely on supervised learning with labeled query-augmentation pairs, DeepRetrieval lets models learn through direct trial and error, using retrieval metrics as rewards to generate queries that maximize retrieval performance.

The system works by having an LLM generate reasoning steps in a `<think>` section followed by the final augmented query in an `<answer>` section. This structured approach enables explicit chain-of-thought reasoning before committing to a query formulation.

## Key Features and Results

- **No Supervision Required**: Eliminates the need for expensive human-annotated or distilled reference queries
- **Powerful Performance**: Significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
  - 65.07% recall (vs. previous SOTA 24.68%) for publication search
  - 63.18% recall (vs. previous SOTA 32.11%) for clinical trials search
- **Versatile Applications**: Excels across diverse retrieval tasks: (1) Literature search using real-world search engines (2) Evidence-seeking retrieval (3) Classic information retrieval (4) SQL database search
- **Parameter Efficient**: Achieves superior results with only 3B parameters, outperforming larger models like **GPT-4o** and **Claude-3.5-Sonnet**

## 📦 Installation

**General Installation (for all retrieval methods):**
```
conda create -n zero python=3.9
# install torch [or you can skip this step and let vllm to install the correct version for you]
pip install torch==2.4.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
# install vllm
pip3 install vllm==0.6.3 # or you can install 0.5.4, 0.4.2 and 0.3.1
pip3 install ray

# verl
cd code
pip install -e .

# flash attention 2
pip3 install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
# quality of life
pip install wandb IPython matplotlib huggingface_hub
```

**(If you only want to run the Search Engine Retrieval, you can skip the following steps.)**

If using sparse retrieval (e.g., BM25) or dense retrieval (e.g., DPR), please also install the following:
```
# we use pyserini for efficient retrieval and evaluation
pip install pyserini    # the version we used is 0.22.1

# if you don't have faiss installed, install it with:
pip install faiss-gpu==1.7.2    # the version we used is 1.7.2

# if you don't have java installed, install it with:
pip install install-jdk && python -c "import jdk; jdk.install('11')"

# support sql execution
pip install func_timeout
```

## ⚡️ Easy-to-use API for Query Rewriting

```bash
sh vllm_host.sh # you can specify the local port and the model to use
python query_rewrite.py --query "Who built DeepRetrieval in 2025?"
# Original query: Who built DeepRetrieval in 2025?
# Rewritten query: (The DeepRetrieval system, which was built in 2025)
```



## 🫧 Get Started

### **1. Dataset Download/Preprocess**

We provide two options for data preparation:

<details>
<summary style="font-weight: bold;">🚀 Option 1: Download pre-processed datasets from Huggingface (Recommended)</summary>

All preprocessed datasets are available on our Huggingface repository. You can download them using the provided script:

```bash
cd code
# List available datasets
python download_datasets.py --list_only --repo_id DeepRetrieval/datasets

# Download all datasets
python download_datasets.py --repo_id DeepRetrieval/datasets --output_dir ./data

# Or download specific categories/datasets
python download_datasets.py --categories search_engine --datasets pubmed_32 --output_dir ./data
```
</details>


<details>
<summary style="font-weight: bold;">⛏️ Option 2: Process the data yourself</summary>

For example, for PubMed:
```bash
cd code
python download_datasets.py --categories raw_data --datasets pubmed --output_dir ./data
python data_preprocess/pubmed_32.py
```
(This will generate the required data structures in the appropriate format, but requires raw data access and more processing time.)
</details>


### **2. Get Your Search Engine API Key (required if use search engine)**

For example, for PubMed, you may get it following the instruction [here](https://support.nlm.nih.gov/kbArticle/?pn=KA-05317). (PubMed API is 100% ✨FREE✨ to use!)

Then, put it in under `code/verl/utils/reward_score/apis/` as `pubmed_api.key`.


### **3. Reward function Related (optional)**

Reward Design (e.g., in `code/verl/utils/reward_score/pubmed.py`):


| Recall      | ≥ 0.7 | ≥ 0.5 | ≥ 0.4 | ≥ 0.3 | ≥ 0.1 | ≥ 0.05 | < 0.05 |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Reward**  | +5.0  | +4.0  | +3.0  | +1.0  | +0.5  | +0.1   | -3.5   |



### **4. Customize Monitor Info (optional)**

modify `compute_reward_metrics()` in `code/verl/trainer/ppo/ray_trainer.py`


## 🏃 Run Training
```bash
conda activate zero
```

For example, for PubMed:
```bash
sh scripts/train/pubmed_32.sh 
```
(if you see Out-of-vram, try add `critic.model.enable_gradient_checkpointing=True` to the script)

### Think/Query Length During Training (PubMed)

![alt text](/images/length_study_horizontal.png "think length and query length during training")


## 🧐 Run Evaluation

```
sh scripts/eval/pubmed_32.sh
```
(You can run this script without training, as it will download our trained model from Huggingface by default)

## ⚠️ Commonly Encountered Issues

### ⚙️ Cluster Setup: CUDA and Conda Environment

<details>
<summary><b>💻 slurm-related</b></summary>

Before running any training or evaluation scripts on the cluster, make sure to **load the correct CUDA module** and **activate your Conda environment**.

---

### 🧩 GPUs Allocation

If your CUDA inside a SLURM job doesn’t match the CUDA seen by your Python script, you may get a warning like:

UserWarning: CUDA initialization: CUDA driver initialization failed, you might not have a CUDA GPU.
(Triggered internally at ../c10/cuda/CUDAFunctions.cpp:108.)
return torch._C._cuda_getDeviceCount() > 0


To fix this, **do not manually set your CUDA device** inside the script.  
Instead, load the CUDA module directly inside your SLURM job:

Add the following lines **before running any Python commands**:

```bash
# --- Load CUDA module ---
module load cuda/12.6

# --- Activate Conda environment ---
source ~/miniconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh  # adjust path if your conda installation differs
conda activate zero
```
If you previously specified a device inside your training script or job file (e.g., pubmed_32.sh), remove lines like:

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=4,7
This ensures CUDA is managed correctly by SLURM.

### ⚙️ Dependency Conflicts
When setting up the environment, you might encounter pip dependency warnings such as:
```
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.
This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
matplotlib 3.9.4 requires pyparsing>=2.3.1, which is not installed.
mne 1.8.0 requires decorator, which is not installed.
pyhealth 1.1.4 requires bitsandbytes, which is not installed.
```

To fix these missing dependencies, simply run:
```bash
pip install pyparsing decorator bitsandbytes
```

You may also encounter NumPy incompatibility warnings like:
```
pyhealth 1.1.4 requires numpy<2.0, but you have numpy 2.0.2 which is incompatible.
outlines 0.0.46 requires numpy<2.0.0, but you have numpy 2.0.2 which is incompatible.
vllm 0.6.3 requires numpy<2.0.0, but you have numpy 2.0.2 which is incompatible.
```
To fix these, reinstall a compatible NumPy version and re-install dependent packages:
```bash
pip install pyserini
pip install "numpy<2.0.0" --force-reinstall
pip install transformers==4.46.3
pip install vllm==0.6.3
pip install verl==0.1
pip install pyhealth==1.1.4
pip install outlines==0.0.46

```
